# PulzeLock
Today, fingerprint authentication systems are still susceptible to biometric spoofs. One way to combat this is to check for signs of liveness in users. Photoplethysmography (PPG; the same biosignals used in smartwatches to estimate heart rate) signals are the optimal solution for proving liveness since they can be used to estimate heart rate, oxygen saturation or breathing rate. More interestingly, since an individual's PPG signal is largely influenced by their cardiovascular system, a user's PPG signal is unique to them.

PulzeLock is an early prototype of a device capable of estimating heart rate, breathing rate, and oxygen saturation using a user's PPG signal. The system also uses the PPG signal to authenticate enrolled users into the system
